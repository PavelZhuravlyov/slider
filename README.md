# Slider
A simple, fluid, touch-enabled carousel adapted from [FlexSlider 2 by Woo Themes](http://www.woothemes.com/flexslider/). Slider includes features designed to make it more usable and accessible:

* Auto-rotation is disabled by default.
* Navigation arrows are permanently visible.
* Navigation arrows are icons, not images, for crisp rendering on retina displays.
* Progressive enhancement. By default, all images and videos are displayed. A small script adds a .js class to the body element, which applies the Slider styles.

For more on carousel usability, read these great articles by [Brad Frost](http://bradfrostweb.com/blog/post/carousels/), [Erik Runyon](http://weedygarden.net/2013/01/carousel-stats/), and the [Nielsen Norman Group](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/auto-forwarding/).

## How It Works
Getting started with Slider is really easy. [View the online tutorial](http://cferdinandi.github.com/slider/) or dig through the `index.html` file.

If you're including videos in your project, you also need to use [FluidVids.js](http://fitvidsjs.com/). Make sure it loads prior to Slider.

### Requires jQuery

FlexSlider requires [jQuery 1.4.2](http://jquery.com/) or higher.
